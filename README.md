# IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certificate-Capstone

This repository is part of the module 9 capstone project of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate and presents a data analysis study of the best neighborhoods in the city of Rio de Janeiro for the installment of a new hostel. The code was mainly written in Python, although R ggplot2 package was employed to create the bar charts. The .pdf report was generated using Latex and the .pdf presentation, using Beamer-Latex.

This repository has the following files:

1) 'Rio Hostel Project.pdf': report.
2) 'Rio Hostel Presentation.pdf': presentation file (slides).
3) 'Rio_Hostel_Project_Final.ipynb': Jupyter notebook with the Python code.
